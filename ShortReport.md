Don't worry this will be in word or pdf format. Just organizing. 

Reports should include: 
* Title page (see sample for specifications)
* Technical methodology section where tools used to complete analysis are identified and, if
applicable, to merge data sets
* Analytical techniques used
* Any assumptions made in the analysis
* Identify any additional data that students merged into the data set and any transformations
made to the data. If additional data was merged into the provided data set, please upload the final data set used to complete the analysis to your Dropbox folder.

## Technically Methodology

### Tools used: 

Python: Web Scraping greatschools.edu to get additional school data, merged data sets using Pandas library. left joins are similar to a V-Lookup in excel. 
<br>

need to say how we merged: 
Tableau: visualized data (and show predictions using tableau (logisitic regression)
<br> 

Hosted tableau dashboard on github.io 

## Analytical Techniques Used


Left join using pandas (python library). We webscraped data using scrapy (web crawling framework). Correlation between columns. Maybe gini index. 

<b>rubric asks for statistic techniques and such, so maybe a thing of bar charts or correlations or really anything </b>
